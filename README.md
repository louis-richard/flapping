## Abstract

 Kink-like flapping motions of current sheets are commonly observed in the magnetotail. Such
  oscillations have periods of a few minutes down to a few seconds and they propagate toward the flanks of the plasma sheet. Here, we report a short-period (Tâ‰ˆ25 s) flapping event of a thin current sheet observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in the dusk-side plasma sheet following a fast earthward plasma flow. We characterize the flapping structure using the multi-spacecraft spatiotemporal derivative and timing methods, and we find that the wave-like structure is propagating along the average current direction with a phase velocity comparable to the ion velocity. We show that the wavelength of the oscillating current sheet scales with its thickness as expected for a drift-kink mode. The decoupling of the ion motion from the electron motion suggests that the current sheet is thin. We observe that in such a thin current sheet, the ion motion becomes chaotic. We discuss the presence of the lower hybrid waves associated with gradients of density as a broadening process of the thin current sheet.
